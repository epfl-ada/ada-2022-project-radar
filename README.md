# Road to beer experts: how do beer tastes evolve through time?

## Abstract

From our experience we can tell that our beer tastes have evolved drastically over the past 10 years. At first, we only drank Pils and found other beers disgusting. Today, we can enjoy IPAs but are not yet satisfied when being served a Hoegaarden. By analyzing ratings submitted on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, two of the largest beer rating websites, we want to determine if these shifts in beer taste are common to other people as well.

<!-- We could try to classify users into different categories, going from complete beginner to expert, based per example on the number of reviews a user has written. It would then be interesting to detect first how these people’s tastes differ from each other, but also if in the beginning an expert had the same tastes/drank similar beers as a complete beginner. By looking at the text reviews through time, we might also find that users develop a specific vocabulary and become more able to express their sentiment towards beer. -->
