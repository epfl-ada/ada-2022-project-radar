# Road to beer experts: how do beer tastes evolve through time?

___Study of the evolution of beer tastes through time___


## Abstract

From our own experience, we can tell that our beer tastes have drastically evolved over the past 10 years. At first, we only drank Pils and found other styles of beer disgusting. Today, we can enjoy an IPA but are not yet satisfied when being served a Guinness.
Then, an obvious question occurs: Are these feelings we perceive also present in other users? 
By analyzing ratings submitted on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, two of the largest beer rating websites, we want to determine if these shifts in beer taste are common to other people as well.

<!-- We could try to classify users into different categories, going from complete beginner to expert, based per example on the number of reviews a user has written. It would then be interesting to detect first how these peopleâ€™s tastes differ from each other, but also if in the beginning an expert had the same tastes/drank similar beers as a complete beginner. By looking at the text reviews through time, we might also find that users develop a specific vocabulary and become more able to express their sentiment towards beer. -->


## Research Questions

- Is there a beer category that serves as a gateway category?
- What are the common characteristics between the first beers users decide to rate?
- Do people with an initial similar beer taste follow a common path? When and why do their paths split?
- There are two ways to rate a beer. Either the final grade of a beer is a weighted average of five different criteria such as appearance, palate or taste, or the user just gives a global grade of the beer. Detecting nuances in the beers is one possible sign of expertise and we would like to analyze if users tend to give more detailed ratings through time or not.

## Data sets used

The datasets of both beer rating websites contain data gathered between 2001 and 2017. They share a common structure and contain the following three files which we use for our analysis:

- **beers.csv**
contains informations about every beer that users can rate on the respective website, e.g. its name, its average rating on the website or the total number of ratings it received. 
- **users.csv**
contains informations about every user that was active on the website between 2001 and 2017, e.g. his username, the place where he lives or the number of ratings he submitted on the website.
- **ratings.txt.gz** keeps track of every rating submitted on the website between 2001 and 2017. A rating is composed of five different criteria: appearance, aroma, palate, taste and overall impression. The user can also further elaborate his feelings by leaving a comment in form of a small text.

## Methods
**Step: Explore RateBeer dataset**
- Prepare the data-set to serve as control website for our findings

**Step: Continue exploring the different datasets and coming up with meaningul visualizations**

**Step: Explore possibility of observational study or decision trees**
- Matching users with similar beer tastes at the beginning, same number of ratings through time and comparing their respective paths. 
- Could also make a decision tree?? Like 
- When do the paths split? Can we determine reasons behind them taking separate paths? What are the common characteristics of people that went on the same path?

**Step: Create an efficient data preprocessing pipeline**
- Determine solid measures in order to justifiy the final data set of valid US users.
- How do we determine if a user is an expert or not.

**Step: Graph Mining**
- Louvain Algorithm:
- Girvan-Newman Algorithm
- Explore different weight definitions incorporating user ratings


**Step: Look for better graph visualization tools**

**Step: Redaction of the final data story**

**Step: Get familiar with GitHub pages and build the final website**
